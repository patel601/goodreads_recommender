# Goodreads Data Analysis and Book Recommendation System
This repository contains a project that performs data analysis on a subset of the Goodreads dataset and builds a book recommendation system. The recommendation system uses the Annoy library to find similar books based on their summaries.

### Short Description
The project includes data preprocessing, feature extraction using TF-IDF vectorization, and the construction of an approximate nearest neighbors search index using Annoy. The goal is to provide book recommendations within the same category based on the content of their summaries.

### Packages Used
- pandas: For data manipulation and analysis
- scikit-learn: For TF-IDF vectorization
- annoy: For efficient approximate nearest neighbor searches
- numpy: For numerical operations

### How to run
